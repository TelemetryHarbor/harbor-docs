# Harbor AI with SQL Query Insights

Harbor Scale's AI-powered insights feature allows you to query your data using natural language. This powerful tool not only provides answers but also reveals the underlying SQL queries used to generate those answers, making it an excellent learning resource for understanding your data and building custom Grafana dashboards.

## How Harbor AI Works

Harbor AI leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate your natural language questions into precise SQL queries. These queries are then executed against your Harbor Scale data, and the results are presented in an easy-to-understand format.

## Benefits of LLM-Powered Insights

-   **Accessibility**: Non-technical users can easily query complex time-series data without writing SQL.
-   **Efficiency**: Rapidly explore data and get answers without manual dashboard creation.
-   **Learning**: The ability to view generated SQL queries serves as an educational tool for understanding database interactions and building your own Grafana queries.
-   **Discovery**: Uncover patterns and insights that might not be immediately obvious through traditional dashboards.
-   **Scalability**: The LLM can handle a wide range of query complexities and data volumes.

## Accessing SQL Queries

Every Harbor AI response includes a "Show SQL Queries" button that reveals the underlying SQL code used to generate the answer.

### Features

-   **View SQL**: Click to expand and see the exact queries used.
-   **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying for reuse in Grafana or other tools.
-   **Multiple Queries**: Some complex questions may generate multiple SQL statements.
-   **Formatted Code**: Properly formatted SQL with syntax highlighting.


## Example Interactions

### Question: "What's the average temperature for Ship1 in the last 24 hours?"

**Harbor AI Response:**
> Based on the data from the last 24 hours, Ship1 has recorded an average temperature of 23.5°C across all temperature sensors.

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT
  AVG(value) as average_temperature,
  COUNT(*) as reading_count
FROM cargo_data
WHERE ship_id = 'Ship1'
  AND cargo_id LIKE '%temperature%'
  AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
```

### Question: "Show me GPS coordinates for all ships in the last hour"

**Harbor AI Response:**
> Here are the latest GPS positions for all active ships in the last hour...

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (ship_id)
  ship_id,
  time,
  MAX(CASE WHEN cargo_id = 'latitude' THEN value END) as latitude,
  MAX(CASE WHEN cargo_id = 'longitude' THEN value END) as longitude
FROM cargo_data
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND cargo_id IN ('latitude', 'longitude')
GROUP BY ship_id, time
ORDER BY ship_id, time DESC
```

### Question: "Which ship has the highest fuel consumption today?"

**Harbor AI Response:**
> Ship3 has the highest fuel consumption today with a total of 145.7 liters consumed.

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT
  ship_id,
  SUM(value) as total_fuel_consumption
FROM cargo_data
WHERE cargo_id = 'fuel_consumption'
  AND time >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY ship_id
ORDER BY total_fuel_consumption DESC
LIMIT 1
```

### Question: "Show me hourly averages for temperature sensors in the last day"

**Harbor AI Response:**
> Here are the hourly temperature averages for all ships over the last 24 hours...

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', time) as hour,
  ship_id,
  AVG(value) as avg_temperature,
  MIN(value) as min_temperature,
  MAX(value) as max_temperature
FROM cargo_data
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND cargo_id LIKE '%temperature%'
GROUP BY time_bucket('1 hour', time), ship_id
ORDER BY hour ASC, ship_id
```

## Learning from AI-Generated Queries

The SQL queries generated by Harbor AI are excellent learning resources:

### 1. **Time Filtering Patterns**

Learn how to properly filter time-series data:

```sql
-- Last 24 hours
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'

-- Today only
WHERE time >= CURRENT_DATE

-- Specific date range
WHERE time BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'

-- Last week
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
```

### 2. **Aggregation Techniques**

Understand different ways to aggregate your data:

```sql
-- Basic aggregations
SELECT AVG(value), MAX(value), MIN(value), COUNT(*)

-- Time-based grouping with time_bucket
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', time) as hour,
  AVG(value)
FROM cargo_data
GROUP BY time_bucket('1 hour', time)

-- Multiple dimensions
SELECT
  ship_id,
  cargo_id,
  AVG(value)
FROM cargo_data
GROUP BY ship_id, cargo_id
```

### 3. **GPS Data Handling**

See how to work with coordinate pairs:

```sql
-- Pivot latitude/longitude
SELECT
  time,
  ship_id,
  MAX(CASE WHEN cargo_id = 'latitude' THEN value END) as lat,
  MAX(CASE WHEN cargo_id = 'longitude' THEN value END) as lng
FROM cargo_data
WHERE cargo_id IN ('latitude', 'longitude')
GROUP BY time, ship_id
```

### 4. **Pattern Matching**

Learn to use LIKE and other pattern matching:

```sql
-- Find temperature-related sensors
WHERE cargo_id LIKE '%temperature%'

-- Find fuel-related data
WHERE cargo_id ILIKE '%fuel%'

-- Multiple patterns
WHERE cargo_id ~ '(temperature|temp|thermal)'
```

## Using AI Queries in Grafana

The SQL queries from Harbor AI can be directly used in Grafana:

1.  **Copy the SQL** from Harbor AI.
2.  **Open Grafana** and create a new panel.
3.  **Paste the query** into the query editor.
4.  **Add Grafana variables** for dynamic filtering:

```sql
-- Original AI query
SELECT AVG(value) FROM cargo_data WHERE ship_id = 'Ship1'

-- Modified for Grafana with variables
SELECT
  time,
  AVG(value) as avg_value
FROM cargo_data
WHERE ship_id IN ($ship_id:sqlstring)
  AND $__timeFilter(time)
ORDER BY time ASC
```

## Advanced Query Patterns

Harbor AI can generate sophisticated queries for complex analysis:

### Window Functions

```sql
SELECT
  time,
  ship_id,
  value,
  LAG(value) OVER (PARTITION BY ship_id ORDER BY time) as previous_value,
  value - LAG(value) OVER (PARTITION BY ship_id ORDER BY time) as change
FROM cargo_data
WHERE cargo_id = 'fuel_level'
ORDER BY ship_id, time
```

### Statistical Analysis

```sql
SELECT
  ship_id,
  AVG(value) as mean_value,
  STDDEV(value) as std_deviation,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY value) as median,
  MIN(value) as min_value,
  MAX(value) as max_value
FROM cargo_data
WHERE cargo_id = 'engine_rpm'
GROUP BY ship_id
```

### Anomaly Detection

```sql
WITH stats AS (
  SELECT
      ship_id,
      AVG(value) as mean_val,
      STDDEV(value) as std_val
  FROM cargo_data
  WHERE cargo_id = 'temperature'
  GROUP BY ship_id
)
SELECT
  c.time,
  c.ship_id,
  c.value,
  s.mean_val,
  ABS(c.value - s.mean_val) / s.std_val as z_score
FROM cargo_data c
JOIN stats s ON c.ship_id = s.ship_id
WHERE c.cargo_id = 'temperature'
  AND ABS(c.value - s.mean_val) / s.std_val > 2
ORDER BY z_score DESC
```

### Time Series Gaps Detection

```sql
WITH time_series AS (
  SELECT
      ship_id,
      time,
      LAG(time) OVER (PARTITION BY ship_id ORDER BY time) as prev_time
  FROM cargo_data
  WHERE cargo_id = 'heartbeat'
      AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
)
SELECT
  ship_id,
  time,
  prev_time,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (time - prev_time))/60 as gap_minutes
FROM time_series
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (time - prev_time))/60 > 30   -- Gaps > 30 minutes
ORDER BY gap_minutes DESC
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Ask Specific Questions**

-   ❌ "Show me data"
-   ✅ "What's the average engine temperature for Ship1 in the last 6 hours?"

### 2. **Learn from the SQL**

-   Study the generated queries to understand patterns.
-   Modify them for your specific needs.
-   Use them as templates for similar analysis.

### 3. **Combine with Grafana**

-   Copy useful queries to Grafana dashboards.
-   Add variables for interactivity.
-   Set up alerts based on AI-discovered patterns.

### 4. **Iterate and Refine**

-   Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper.
-   Request different time ranges or aggregations.
-   Explore edge cases and anomalies.

## Tips for Better Results

1.  **Be Specific**: Include ship names, time ranges, and sensor types.
2.  **Use Domain Terms**: Reference "cargo_id", "ship_id", and specific sensor names.
3.  **Ask for Comparisons**: "Compare fuel efficiency between Ship1 and Ship2".
4.  **Request Trends**: "Show me the trend of engine temperature over the last week".
5.  **Explore Relationships**: "Is there a correlation between speed and fuel consumption?".
6.  **Ask for Aggregations**: "What are the hourly averages for temperature sensors?".
7.  **Request Analysis**: "Find any unusual patterns in the GPS data".

Harbor AI's SQL query feature bridges the gap between natural language questions and technical database queries, making it easier to explore your data and learn SQL patterns for future analysis. The transparency of showing actual SQL queries helps users understand their data better and build more sophisticated visualizations in Grafana.
