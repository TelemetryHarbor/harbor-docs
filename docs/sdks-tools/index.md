# Telemetry Harbor SDKs

Telemetry Harbor provides a robust and easy-to-use platform for ingesting telemetry data from various sources. To simplify integration with your applications and devices, we offer official Software Development Kits (SDKs) for popular programming languages and platforms.

Our SDKs are designed to handle the complexities of API communication, including request formatting, authentication, and retry logic, allowing you to focus on collecting and sending your valuable data.

## Available SDKs

We currently offer SDKs for:

*   [**Python SDK**](/docs/sdks-tools/python): Ideal for backend services, data processing, and general-purpose applications.
*   [**JavaScript/TypeScript SDK**](/docs/sdks-tools/javascript): Perfect for Node.js applications, web services, and potentially browser-based clients (with appropriate CORS configuration).
*   [**C++ (Arduino) SDK**](/docs/sdks-tools/cpp-arduino): Tailored for embedded systems and IoT devices, specifically compatible with Arduino-supported microcontrollers like ESP32/ESP8266.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our SDKs! If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to contribute code, please visit the respective GitHub repositories linked on each SDK's page.

For any questions or support, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or contact our support team.
