# Airport Weather Monitoring

This guide explains how to set up a Linux agent to collect real-time weather data for specified airports from OpenWeatherMap and send it to Telemetry Harbor. This allows you to monitor weather conditions globally, analyze trends, and integrate weather data into your operational dashboards.

**_Repo Link:_** https://github.com/TelemetryHarbor/harbor-airport-weather

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

-   A **Linux** system with **root/sudo** access.
-   **curl** installed for API communication.
-   A working internet connection to fetch weather data and send to Telemetry Harbor.
-   **OpenWeatherMap API key** (free tier available at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)).
-   A **Telemetry Harbor account** (free tier available).
-   Basic knowledge of Linux terminal commands.

## How it Works

The airport weather agent is a bash script that fetches current weather data and air pollution data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a list of configured airports. It then formats this data into the Telemetry Harbor [General Harbor Data Type Model](../introduction/concepts.md#general-harbor-data-type-model) and sends it in batches to your Telemetry Harbor ingestion endpoint at a configurable interval. The agent runs as a `systemd` service for continuous operation.

## Available Metrics

The enhanced airport weather agent collects the following metrics for each airport:

| Metric               | Description              | Units   |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- | :------ |
| Temperature_Fahrenheit | Current temperature      | °F      |
| Feels_Like_F         | Apparent temperature     | °F      |

    -   Choose from sample airports around the world.
    -   Add as many airports as you need.
4.  **Select a sampling rate** for how often weather data is collected:
    -   Every 1 minute
    -   Every 5 minutes (recommended)
    -   Every 15 minutes
    -   Every 30 minutes
    -   Every 1 hour

## Managing the Service

After installation, the airport weather service runs automatically. You can manage it using `systemctl`:

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status harbor-airport

# View logs
journalctl -u harbor-airport -f

# Stop the service
systemctl stop harbor-airport

# Start the service
systemctl start harbor-airport

# Disable automatic startup
systemctl disable harbor-airport

# Enable automatic startup
systemctl enable harbor-airport
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: Failed to send test data point**

-   Verify your API endpoint and key are correct.
-   Check your internet connection.
-   Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections.

**Error: Invalid OpenWeatherMap API key**

-   Verify your API key is correct.
-   Ensure your API key is activated (may take a few minutes after signup).
-   Check you haven't exceeded the free tier limits.

**Service starts but no data appears in Grafana**

-   Check the service logs: `journalctl -u harbor-airport -f`.
-   Verify the airports you selected are valid ICAO codes.
-   Ensure your Telemetry Harbor account is active.

**Missing or incomplete weather data**

-   Some airports may not report all weather metrics consistently.
-   Try adding more airports to ensure consistent data collection.
-   Check if the weather services are experiencing issues.

## Uninstalling

To uninstall the airport weather agent:

1.  Run the installation script again:
    ```bash
    sudo ./install-airport-weather.sh
    ```
2.  Select the "Uninstall Airport Weather Collector" option from the menu.

Alternatively, use the uninstall flag:

```bash
sudo ./install-airport-weather.sh --uninstall
```
