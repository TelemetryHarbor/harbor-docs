# Linux System Monitoring

This guide explains how to set up a lightweight monitoring agent on your Linux servers to collect various system metrics and send them to Telemetry Harbor. This allows you to centralize monitoring, create custom dashboards in Grafana, and set up alerts for your Linux infrastructure.

**_Repo Link:_** https://github.com/TelemetryHarbor/harbor-linux-monitor


## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

-   A **Linux** system with **root/sudo** access.
-   **curl** installed for API communication.
-   A working internet connection to send metrics to Telemetry Harbor.
-   A **Telemetry Harbor account** (free tier available).
-   Basic knowledge of Linux terminal commands.

## How it Works

The Linux monitoring agent is a bash script that leverages standard Linux commands (like `top`, `free`, `df`, `netstat`, `sensors`) to collect system performance metrics. It then formats these metrics into the Telemetry Harbor [General Harbor Data Type Model](../introduction/concepts.md#general-harbor-data-type-model) and sends them in batches to your Telemetry Harbor ingestion endpoint at a configurable interval. The agent runs as a `systemd` service for reliability.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Telemetry Harbor Account

1.  **Sign up** at [Telemetry Harbor](https://telemetryharbor.com/)
2.  **Verify** your email and log in
3.  **Create a Harbor**:
    -   Click **Create Harbor** on your dashboard
    -   Choose a **name** and select **General** as the type
    -   Select the **Free** plan (or upgrade for more data capacity)
    -   Click **Create**
4.  **Retrieve your credentials**:
    -   After creation, go to **View Details**
    -   Note down:
        -   \`API Batch Endpoint\`
        -   \`API Key\`
        -   \`Grafana Endpoint\`
        -   \`Grafana Username\`
        -   \`Grafana Password\`

### 2. Install the Monitoring Agent

1.  Download the installation script:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL -o install-monitoring.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TelemetryHarbor/harbor-linux-monitor/refs/heads/main/install.sh
    ```
2.  Make it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x install-monitoring.sh
    ```
3.  Run the installation script with root privileges:
    ```bash
    sudo ./install-monitoring.sh
    ```

### 3. Configuration During Installation

During installation, you'll be prompted to:

1.  **Enter your Telemetry Harbor API details**:
    -   API Batch Endpoint URL
    -   API Key
2.  **Select a sampling rate** for how often metrics are collected:
    -   Every 1 second
    -   Every 5 seconds
    -   Every 30 seconds
    -   Every 1 minute (default)
    -   Every 5 minutes
3.  **Choose which metrics to monitor** using either:
    -   Interactive checkbox menu (arrow keys to navigate, space to select)
    -   Simple number entry

## Available Metrics

The monitoring agent can collect the following metrics:

| Metric              | Description                                   |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| CPU Usage           | Overall CPU utilization percentage            |
| CPU Cores           | Individual CPU core usage percentages         |
| RAM Usage           | Memory usage percentage                       |
| RAM Detailed        | Detailed memory statistics (used, free, cached, etc.) |
| Disk Usage          | Root partition usage percentage               |
| Disk All            | Usage for all mounted partitions              |
| Load Average        | System load averages (1, 5, and 15 minutes)   |
| Processes           | Total number of running processes             |

| Boot Time           | When the system was last booted               |

| Battery             | Battery status and capacity (if applicable)   |

## Managing the Service

After installation, the monitoring service runs automatically. You can manage it using `systemctl`:

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status harbor-monitor

# View logs
journalctl -u harbor-monitor -f

# Stop the service
systemctl stop harbor-monitor

# Start the service
systemctl start harbor-monitor

# Disable automatic startup
systemctl disable harbor-monitor

# Enable automatic startup
systemctl enable harbor-monitor
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall the monitoring agent:

1.  Run the installation script again:
    ```bash
    sudo ./install-monitoring.sh
    ```
2.  Select the "Uninstall Harbor Monitor" option from the menu.

Alternatively, use the uninstall flag:

```bash
sudo ./install-monitoring.sh --uninstall
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: Failed to send test data point**

-   Verify your API endpoint and key are correct.
-   Check your internet connection.
-   Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections.

**Service starts but no data appears in Grafana**

-   Check the service logs: `journalctl -u harbor-monitor -f`.
-   Verify the metrics are being collected correctly.
-   Ensure your Telemetry Harbor account is active.

**High CPU usage from the monitoring service**

-   Increase the sampling rate to reduce frequency.
-   Reduce the number of metrics being collected.
-   Check for any system issues that might be causing high CPU usage.
